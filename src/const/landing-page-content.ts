  Questions: [
    {
      question: 'Why does this app exist ?',
      answer:
        "As someone with a mind full of ideas and projects, I needed an app to help stay organized and motivated. I realized that seeing my progress was what encouraged me to keep going. Whether it was learning anatomical drawing, 3D modeling, woodworking, or getting back to finishing web apps I had left aside, there were always so many things pulling my attention away from investing the time and effort I wanted—especially with all today's distractions.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Is it free ?',
      answer:
        'Yes, it is 100% free to use. There is a max files storage limit of 200MB per user. I might increase it in the future if the need arises.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why would I use this instead of Notion or more mature note taking apps?',
      answer:
        'As this project is like every others personal projets : uncomplete and probably buggy at some points, the reason why you could use it can be curiosity, simplicity of use and making it your own by contributing to it.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I contribute to the project ?',
      answer:
        'You can contribute to the project by reporting bugs, suggesting features : every idea is welcome, or even directly contributing code.',
    },
